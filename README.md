exchange with society had expanded its scope. Accordingly, the QR scanner software is the
medium that commonly and mostly used by the people. This technology has made it more
efficient and effective for us to do our daily chores easily and quickly, because everything is
on our fingertips. Currently, as a way to contact irresponsible parker is by using the
conventional approach of seeking the person responsible for the infringement parking
without any contact information left inside the car. From a survey conducted, 86.4% of the
respondents have faced the similar problem. Thus, the main aim of this project is to create a
parking contact system (Parkerly) which are integrated with a quick response (QR) code
scanner, automated data entry technology for fast recording of data by scanning the provided
QR code. The mobile app will be developed using cross-platform development that will be
carried out and tested on Android, IOS and the Web.
